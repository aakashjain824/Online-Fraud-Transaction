# Online-Fraud-Transaction

For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download) Iâ€™m using here:

* step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour
* type: type of online transaction
* amount: the amount of the transaction
* nameOrig: customer starting the transaction
* oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction
* newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction
* nameDest: recipient of the transaction
* oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction
* newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction
* isFraud: fraud transaction
